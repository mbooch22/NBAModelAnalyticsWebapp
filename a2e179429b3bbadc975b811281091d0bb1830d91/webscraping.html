							<p>Using a separate proprietary web scraping application, NBA stats over the past decade were retrieved from every game played.</p>
                            <p>*Raw Average stats were calculated by taking the raw average of the combined statistics for a given team/player. 
                                Home and Away statistics were also filtered to get a better understanding of Home Advantage.
                                Adjusted stats were then calculated to compensate for data imbalances due to varying opponents' and other outlying figures.
                            </p>
